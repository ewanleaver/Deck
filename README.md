# Deck

A Kanji flashcard study application for iOS.

Currently a work in progress, this project has been designed around the concept of swipable cards to mimic physical interaction with a real deck of cards.

The idea is to encourage daily study by creating an application with a dynamic and fun UI, lowering the mental barrier to opening the app and interacting with it for a few minutes during daily commutes etc.

# Notes

Supporting iOS 8+ on iPhone.

Seeing as I only have an iPhone 6 Plus to hand, I currently cannot guarentee the layout on smaller devices (partcularly iPhone 5S and below).
